# Building-Neural-Network-from-scratch

The XOR gate returns 1 only when exactly only one of its inputs is 1 else it returns 0:

To perform the XOR gate operation, we build a simple neural network as shown in the following figure. We have an input layer with two nodes, a hidden layer with five nodes and an output layers which consist of one node:

The network learns by adjusting weights using gradient descent over multiple iterations.
At the end, it plots the cost function, showing the networkâ€™s improvement.
